# Machine Learning Prediction For Boulder County Temperature Data 

## Introduction 

The goals of the original study were to demonstrate bivoltinism in pine beetles in the boulder county region of Colorado. Bivoltinism is when a species produces 2 broods in a season. Included in the study is air temperature data spanning from 1953 - 2014.

## Summary of Data to be Analyzed ## 

### The air temperature data was gathered from the C-1 climate station located at the Niwot Ridge LTER site in Niwot, Colorado. ###

### The data available to me is the max temperature, min temperature, mean temperature, and GDDs (Difference from mean temperature of -5.5).  ###

**The data is formatted in a csv file**

**The csv file is only 7KB**

**There is nothing that looks problematic about the data, and I canâ€™t seem to find any empty entries, but it is a lot of data, and those things will be easier to check for once I begin coding with the dataset.**

**The data is not exactly biology, but it is related to climate science, which is closely related to biology as climate affects the balance of biological systems. **

## Detailed Description of Analysis to be Done and Challenges Involved ##

Can the weather data be used to display a trend in the temperature data as it relates to climate change, and can a machine learning neural network be effective in predicting future temperatures after 2014. Predicted data can be compared to current data from 2015-2020. The computational challenges of this project are immense, but I believe that because I am slowly becoming more adept with machine learning through my work at NCAR, I will be able to set up a simple neural network to predict future data.
